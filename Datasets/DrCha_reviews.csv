review,sentiment
"I just watched the first episode and it’s 10/10. Im in love with it! My mom also left her dream of a clothing boutique because of my grandma at the time to raise me and my sister. Later she kept saying, the trends I’ve gone, I’m a old woman, I can’t catch up with the world. Today, with my own money I’ve set up a boutique for my mother and it’s doing quite well, she really had the skill all along. It’s small now… but one day it will grow bigger. I’m going to show this to my mom too.",positive

"Accidentally watched the first episode, it was so good couldn't stop myself from watching the 2nd episode, this drama is freaking awesome, I'll be waiting every week for the coming episodes.",positive
This actress is hilarious!,positive
Looks very entertaining,positive
annoying unnecesarry romantic scene,negative
I love this drama so much,positive
"Too convoluted and over dramatic. Dr Cha needed to be an assertive confident female whilst this character is weak willed, indecisive and for a woman who has raised two kids well; the writers could have made her a lot stronger in character.",negative
Really good to see Km Byung Chul in a more comedic setting, he is a truly versatile actor who seemed to be typecast as the villain for many of his roles. As always, I look forward to the ever youthful and all-round talented Uhm Jung Hwa's performance!,positive
disappointed if the writers keep this marriage together in the end. ,negative
If she doesn't divorce her husband m not watching anymore ,negative
so slow to watch,negative
"The movie really disappoint me, his mother will have more pain when she finds out that his children helped him cover up his other family. I",negative
Loved the first 2 episodes and excited for the remainder.,positive
